# Zipped Scripts
To install, download the zip and upload the zip to your scenario using the script manager.

## Disguise Kit
This is like a massively supercharged password script. Offers ultimate secrecy and protection for your true script, with a full suite of features, hidden behind a password that must be matched (case sensitive) in the inital prompt or memory (usually through placeholders) to activate.


This includes the E/N script (detailed below), and those features are active whether a password is detected or not.


Otherwise, if no password is detected, your scenario behaves exactly like a normal scenario. The prompt / memory / AN / WI you put in to the scenario editor all work.

HOWEVER, it kicks into high gear when it detects a password, replacing the prompt, memory, and the A/N. It also deletes all the old WIs and puts in up to 10 new ones and offers the floating text feature.

All the replacement text is filled in by the user after uploading the script. The **SHARED** tab has a list of variables to fill in and instructions on how to do so.


## Editor's Note
Implements the "/en", "/hang", "/editor", and "display" commands. 

When you type "/en" (without quotes, in do/say/story, w/e) followed by a space and any text excepting line breaks, such as "write a paragraph about her face, her striking beauty", the command will put a hidden editor's note directly at the front of your context. The editor's note will remain for your next *new input* or *continue*, then it will disappear. If you *retry* after setting an E/N will apply, but won't be cleared, and will *also* apply to your next input/continue.

The EN formats your text as such:

\[Editor's note: **write a paragraph about her face, her striking beauty**.\]

"\[Editor's note: " ...gets added to the front of your text... ".\]" gets added to the back.



The "/hang" command places any text that follows (it after a space, and excluding linebreaks) as a hidden hanging floater that goes just after your inputs, but just before the E/N. 

"/hang" doesn't do any formatting, so make sure to bracket your text with [] if you don't want it getting weird. 

"/hang" text stays around until you overwrite it with a new "/hang" or type "/hang" again without any text afterwards (which removes the floater).


"/editor" puts you into editor mode. In editor mode, all of your inputs will get converted into E/Ns using the same formatting as /en. Your original input will be deleted; however, you will still continue through context and to output (the AI returning text) using the E/N generated by your original input. 

Unlike the /en command, the "/editor" E/Ns will stay around until you put a new note in through input.

You can type "/editor" again while in Editor mode to exit the mode and remove the editor mode E/N.

Editor mode E/Ns stack with "/en" E/Ns and hangs.


"/display" shows the editor mode E/N at the top of your screen. Use "/display" again to turn the display off.


## Stats and Killbot
Uses the stat menu to track the classic D&D style attributes (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA). Assigns your attributes randomly (from 8 to 12) on startup. Choosing a profession via the scenario prompt can give you additional stat modifiers.

Uses a hidden catnip 3.0 character sheet to descriptively inform the AI how good each of your attributes are.

Uses KillBot to give you experience points, and has an increasing exp requirement for leveling up. Leveling up gives you more stat buy points.  


## Universitas Arcanorum (formerly Spell Schools)
This script has evolved from its original purpose into a custom script for RogueSphinx's Universitas Arcanorum scenario.

Uses the skill menu to track your skills in the classic D&D spell schools (abjuration, etc). Each spell school has a 33% chance to start at 1 or 2. The others start at 0. Specializing in a school via the scenario prompt can give you additional skill modifiers.

Uses a hidden catnip 3.0 floating character sheet to descriptively inform the AI how skilled you are in each spell school.

Uses a custom WI replacer to swap out the first (dummy) WI with a spellbook. Whenever that spellbook WI is triggered, another script replaces it with a catnip 3.0-formatted floating spellbook that appears just behind the A/N.

Tracks when you get a familiar and what type it is, then updates both a familiar WI and a floating character sheet with the information. When the WI is changed, so is the character sheet.

Uses FamiliarBot to give you experience points, experience rationale, and witty pet comentary. Commentary is from your familiar (as above), and uses its name (if any). Commentary only appears when you have a familiar. 

Has an increasing exp requirement for leveling up. Leveling up gives you more skill buy points.

Uses a tic stystem to track time manage an event system. Event system uses hidden E/Ns to drive the AI to introduce requested story elements.
