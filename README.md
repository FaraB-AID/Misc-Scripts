# Misc Scripts
Random AID scripts that don't fall into larger projects.


## Zipped Scripts
Multi-file scripts that require you download the zip, then upload the zip to your scenario using the script manager. More detailed information available on each in the folder's readme.

###### Prompt Generator
Fairly straightforward script that creates a hidden bonus floating Author's Note and temporary hanging Editor's Note from entries into a scenario prompt. Includes a /show command to paste them as an output.

###### SafePlay Room
A multiplayer chat / roleplay room script that allows AI to be toggled (default off), allows one-shot directed AI outputs through a command that produces an Editor's Note and creates color-coded consent level commands. Dice roller included for tabletop goodness.

###### Disguise Kit
This is like a massively supercharged password script. Offers ultimate secrecy and protection for your true script, with a full suite of features, hidden behind a password that must be matched (case sensitive) in the inital prompt or memory to activate.

###### Stats and Killbot
Uses the stat menu to track the classic D&D style attributes (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA), and KillBot to manage exp and leveling.

###### Universitas Arcanorum (formerly Spell Schools)
This script has evolved from its original purpose into a custom script for RogueSphinx's Universitas Arcanorum scenario.


###### Editor's Note
A variety of tools regarding Editor's Notes and hidden hanging text. Implements the "/en", "/hang", "/editor", and "display" commands. 


## Single Scripts
Single-file scripts that require you copy the text, then paste it replacing the indicated modifier. Most also include instructions for you to follow to customize or complete the script. More detailed information available on each in the folder's readme.

###### Dice Roller
Adds the /roll command, creating a comprehensive dice-roller that informs players of results through messages. Built with MP in mind, but could be adapted for single-player scenarios.

###### Floating Text
Floats whatever you write into the indicated location # lines breaks back in the text.


###### Prompt Extender
Adds extra text directly after your prompt on scenario generation, before it gets sent to the player/AI.


###### Password Script
This is a script to password lock scenarios.
