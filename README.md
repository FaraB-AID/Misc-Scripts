## Stats and Killbot
Uses the stat menu to track the classic D&D style attributes (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA). Assigns your attributes randomly (from 8 to 12) on startup. Choosing a profession via the scenario prompt can give you additional stat modifiers.

Uses a hidden catnip 3.0 character sheet to descriptively inform the AI how good each of your attributes are.
